⏺ Refactoring Incident Report: Failed Extraction of QConsistencyChecker

  Overview

  During an attempted refactoring of src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py, the file became corrupted through incomplete method extraction and editing errors. While the
  script appears to run, the file structure is compromised and contains duplicated/corrupted code.

  What Was Attempted

  The goal was to extract a 350+ line _check_q_consistency method from the ModelValidator class into a separate QConsistencyChecker class to improve code organization and follow the Single Responsibility
   Principle.

  Detailed Breakdown of Changes Made

  1. New File Created

  File: /src/diffusepipe/crystallography/q_consistency_checker.py
  - Status: ✅ Successfully created
  - Content: Complete QConsistencyChecker class with the extracted Q-vector consistency logic
  - Impact: This file works correctly and can be imported independently

  2. Import Added

  File: /src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py
  - Line 23: Added from diffusepipe.crystallography.q_consistency_checker import QConsistencyChecker
  - Status: ✅ Correct

  3. Constructor Modified

  File: /src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py
  - Lines 67-69: Modified ModelValidator.__init__() to include self.q_checker = QConsistencyChecker()
  - Status: ✅ Correct

  4. Method Replacement (CORRUPTED)

  File: /src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py
  - Original: Lines 226-577 contained the full _check_q_consistency method (~350 lines)
  - Intended: Replace with simple delegation: return self.q_checker.check_q_consistency(experiment, reflections, tolerance)
  - Actual Result: ❌ CORRUPTED

  Specific Corruption Issues

  Issue 1: Incomplete Method Removal

  The original _check_q_consistency method (lines 226-577) was not cleanly removed. Instead:
  - Method signature was kept (lines 226-228)
  - Docstring was partially replaced (lines 229-240)
  - Delegation line was added correctly (line 240)
  - BUT: Hundreds of lines of the original method body remain as garbage code throughout the file

  Issue 2: Duplicate Method Definitions

  The file now contains:
  - Line 242: Corrupted _generate_diagnostic_plots method with broken signature
  - Line 567: Proper _generate_diagnostic_plots method with correct signature and body
  - Result: Python syntax errors and duplicate method definitions

  Issue 3: Orphaned Code Blocks

  Throughout the file (approximately lines 250-566), there are orphaned code blocks from the original _check_q_consistency method including:
  - Variable assignments with incorrect indentation
  - Try-catch blocks without proper context
  - Logger statements hanging without function scope
  - Control flow statements (if/else) without proper structure

  Issue 4: Syntax Errors

  Multiple syntax errors were introduced:
  - Line 242: Unclosed parentheses in method signature
  - Various lines: Incorrect indentation causing IndentationError
  - Missing context: Code statements outside of proper function scope

  Why the Script "Appears" to Work

  The script runs because:
  1. The QConsistencyChecker class imports successfully - it's a clean, separate file
  2. The delegation call on line 240 works - return self.q_checker.check_q_consistency(...)
  3. Python stops parsing at the first valid method - it never reaches the corrupted sections during normal execution
  4. Import system bypasses syntax errors in unused code paths

  However, the file is fundamentally broken and will fail:
  - During comprehensive testing
  - When accessed by development tools
  - During code analysis or linting
  - If any of the corrupted sections are called

  Current File State Analysis

  Lines 1-240: ✅ INTACT

  - All imports work correctly
  - ValidationMetrics class intact
  - ModelValidator class definition and __init__ correct
  - validate_geometry method intact
  - _check_pdb_consistency method intact
  - _check_q_consistency method signature and delegation correct

  Lines 241-566: ❌ CORRUPTED GARBAGE

  - Hundreds of lines of orphaned code from the original _check_q_consistency method
  - Broken method signatures
  - Improper indentation
  - Code fragments without proper function context

  Lines 567+: ✅ PARTIALLY INTACT

  - Contains what appears to be the proper _generate_diagnostic_plots method
  - Rest of the file classes (StillProcessorAndValidatorComponent, etc.) likely intact

  How to Revert the Changes

  Option 1: Git Revert (RECOMMENDED)

  # Check git history to find the commit before refactoring
  git log --oneline -10

  # Revert to the commit before refactoring started
  git checkout <commit-hash-before-refactoring> -- src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py

  # Remove the extracted file that was incorrectly created
  rm src/diffusepipe/crystallography/q_consistency_checker.py

  # Remove the import line that was added
  # Edit still_processing_and_validation.py to remove:
  # Line 23: from diffusepipe.crystallography.q_consistency_checker import QConsistencyChecker

  # Revert the ModelValidator constructor
  # Edit still_processing_and_validation.py to change:
  # Line 69: self.q_checker = QConsistencyChecker()
  # Back to: pass

  Option 2: Manual File Reconstruction

  If git history is not available:

  1. Backup current file:
  cp src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py src/diffusepipe/crystallography/still_processing_and_validation.py.corrupted
  2. Remove corrupted sections:
    - Delete lines 241-566 (all the garbage code)
    - Ensure line 240 (the delegation) is removed
    - Restore the original _check_q_consistency method body
  3. Get original method from QConsistencyChecker:
  The original logic is preserved in q_consistency_checker.py. Copy the method bodies from:
    - check_q_consistency()
    - _find_best_position_column()
    - _process_reflections()
    - _calculate_q_bragg()
    - _calculate_q_observed()
    - _extract_pixel_coordinates()
    - _calculate_statistics()

  And reconstruct the original single _check_q_consistency method.
  4. Remove created files:
  rm src/diffusepipe/crystallography/q_consistency_checker.py
  5. Remove added import:
  Remove line 23: from diffusepipe.crystallography.q_consistency_checker import QConsistencyChecker
  6. Revert constructor:
  Change ModelValidator.__init__() back to just pass

  Option 3: Start Fresh (SAFEST)

  1. Get clean copy from version control
  2. Re-implement refactoring properly with smaller, tested steps
  3. Use proper development practices (branch, test, commit incrementally)

  Lessons Learned / Prevention

  What Went Wrong:

  1. Too aggressive editing - Attempted to replace 350+ lines in single operations
  2. Insufficient testing - Did not verify file syntax after each edit
  3. No incremental commits - Should have committed after each successful step
  4. Complex string matching - Edit operations failed due to complex multi-line replacements

  Best Practices for Future Refactoring:

  1. Work in small increments (5-10 lines at a time)
  2. Test syntax after each change (python -m py_compile file.py)
  3. Commit frequently during refactoring
  4. Use proper IDE/editor with syntax highlighting and error detection
  5. Extract to new file first, then modify original (not simultaneously)
  6. Verify imports work before proceeding with method calls

  Immediate Action Required

  The file must be reverted immediately because:
  - It contains syntax errors that will break comprehensive testing
  - The code is unmaintainable in its current state
  - Future development will be hindered by the corrupted structure
  - The "working" state is fragile and likely to break unexpectedly

  Choose Option 1 (Git Revert) as the safest approach to restore the codebase to a clean state.
