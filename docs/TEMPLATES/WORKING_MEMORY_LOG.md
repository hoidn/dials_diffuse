# Developer Working Memory Log

## Current Task/Focus (As of: 2025-06-11)

**Goal:** `VALIDATION STRATEGY CLARIFICATION - Establish Q-vector validation as primary geometric validation method`

**Key Requirements/Acceptance Criteria (ALL MET):**
1.  ✅ Establish formal Q-vector validation priority decision (plan.md Section 0.7)

## Recent Activity Log & Progress

*   **2025-06-11:**
    *   **VALIDATION STRATEGY DECISION COMPLETED - DOCUMENTATION ALIGNMENT:**
    *   **Goal Achieved:** Established Q-vector consistency checking as the primary geometric validation method
    *   **Key Decisions Made:**
        *   ✅ Q-vector validation (`q_model` vs `q_observed`) is the primary method (Module 1.S.1.Validation)
        *   ✅ Pixel-based validation positioned as diagnostic tool/fallback, not primary approach
        *   ✅ Formal decision documented in plan.md Section 0.7 for project clarity
        *   ✅ All documentation aligned on consistent validation strategy
    *   **Documentation Updates Completed:**
        *   ✅ plan.md Section 0.7: Added formal validation strategy decision
        *   ✅ docs/06_DIALS_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md: Updated to emphasize Q-vector validation priority
        *   ✅ Configuration types: Enhanced for dual DIALS processing modes
        *   ✅ Created comprehensive IDL specifications for masking components
    *   **Technical Foundation Established:**
        *   ✅ Q-vector validation compares `q_model = s1 - s0` vs `q_observed` from pixel coordinates
        *   ✅ Uses `q_consistency_tolerance_angstrom_inv` for pass/fail criteria
        *   ✅ Goal: Mean `|Δq|` typically < 0.01 Å⁻¹ for good data
        *   ✅ Pixel validation available as diagnostic: `|observed_px - calculated_px|` ≤ 1-2 pixels
        *   ✅ Dual processing pathways: Stills vs sequence data detection and routing

*   **Previous Context (from Phase 0):**
    *   DIALS adapter integration working with real CBF files
    *   Spot finding and processing pipeline established
    *   PDB parameters correctly integrated for unit cell/space group
    *   Foundation set for Phase 1 crystallographic processing

1.  **Documentation Synchronization Complete:**
    *   Validation methodology now consistent across all documentation

## Implementation Notes & Decisions Made

### **Validation Methodology Decision:**
*   **Adopted Q-Vector Validation as Primary:** Formally established Q-vector consistency checking as the primary geometric validation method
*   **Rationale:** Provides robust geometric validation while maintaining compatibility with crystallographic conventions
*   **Implementation:** Compare `q_model` (from DIALS s1-s0) vs `q_observed` (from pixel coordinate recalculation)
*   **Tolerance Strategy:** Use `q_consistency_tolerance_angstrom_inv` with goal of mean |Δq| < 0.01 Å⁻¹
*   **Fallback/Diagnostic:** Pixel-based validation available as simpler debugging tool when Q-vector issues persist

### **Configuration Design:**
*   **Dual Processing Support:** Added fields for `force_processing_mode`, `sequence_processing_phil_overrides`, `data_type_detection_enabled`
*   **Q-Vector Validation:** Primary tolerance via `q_consistency_tolerance_angstrom_inv` field
*   **Backward Compatibility:** Existing configuration interfaces maintained
*   **Clear Semantics:** Configuration field names clearly indicate purpose and processing pathway

### **Testing Strategy:**
*   **IDL Specifications:** Comprehensive interface definitions for masking components
*   **Dual Processing Coverage:** Tests for both stills and sequence processing pathways
*   **Q-Vector Validation:** Test framework ready for q_model vs q_observed validation scenarios
*   **Configuration Testing:** Verification of dual processing mode selection and PHIL parameter handling
