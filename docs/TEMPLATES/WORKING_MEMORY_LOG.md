## Resolved Critical Issues

### **Test Suite Maintenance and Reliability Enhancement:**
*   **Latest (2025-06-12):** Successfully resolved all 7 DIALSGenerateMaskAdapter test failures with 0 regressions introduced  
*   **Previous:** Resolved all 11 critical test failures across multiple components with systematic mock improvements
*   **Earlier:** Reduced failures from 22 to 8 (64% improvement), establishing stable foundation
*   **Current Status:** 196 passed, 2 skipped tests with highly stable test suite 
*   **Impact:** Comprehensive test coverage for DIALS C++ object integration with proper mocking patterns

### **Test Strategy and Mocking Problems:**
*   **Before:** Excessive mocking leading to tests that passed but didn't validate real functionality
*   **Enhanced (2025-06-12):** Systematic Mock → MagicMock migration with real DIALS component integration where feasible, plus C++ object compatibility fixes
*   **Current:** Strategic use of real flex arrays, proper magic method mocking, and C++ compatible mock classes for authentic DIALS integration testing
*   **Latest:** Created reusable mock class patterns for C++ backed DIALS objects (ExperimentList, etc.) with proper isinstance() compatibility
*   **Impact:** Tests now validate actual implementation behavior, handle C++ type conversion requirements, and provide reliable integration validation

### **DIALS API Compatibility Issues:**
*   **Before:** Multiple test failures due to incorrect method calls and import patterns
*   **After:** Corrected API usage with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
*   **Impact:** Future-proof integration with DIALS library updates and version changes

### **Visual Diagnostics Gap:**
*   **Before:** No automated visual verification tools for Phase 2 diffuse extraction pipeline
*   **After:** Comprehensive visual diagnostic suite with 8 plot types and end-to-end orchestration
*   **Impact:** Developers can now systematically verify Phase 2 implementation correctness

### **DataExtractor Visualization Limitations:**
*   **Before:** NPZ output lacked pixel coordinates needed for spatial analysis and detector visualization
*   **After:** Enhanced DataExtractor with optional pixel coordinate tracking for visual diagnostics
*   **Impact:** Enables pixel overlay plots, intensity heatmaps, and spatial verification

### **Development Workflow Integration:**
*   **Before:** Manual, error-prone process to test complete pipeline from CBF to verification
*   **After:** Automated end-to-end script orchestrating DIALS processing, masking, extraction, and diagnostics
*   **Impact:** Streamlined development workflow with comprehensive intermediate file preservation

### **Previous: DIALS API Compatibility Failures (Remediated):**
*   **Issue:** 32 failing tests due to DIALS API breaking changes (`master_phil_scope` → `phil_scope`)
*   **Resolution:** Fixed PHIL imports, mock patching strategies, and integration test patterns
*   **Outcome:** Improved test pass rate from 132 to 171 tests, stable foundation for development
